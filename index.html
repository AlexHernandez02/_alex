<p>In high school, Radke and Max Green were close friends. In 2004, Bryan Money contacted Max looking for a vocalist, who referred him to Radke. Bryan agreed and began auditions for a drummer. Robert Ortiz was selected, and Escape The Fate was formed. A few weeks later, Omar Espinosa, who was the current guitarist at the time for Lovehatehero, decided to join as rhythm guitarist. The band soon began to play in the post-hardcore scene in Las Vegas. During that time Carson Allen joined as their keyboardist. The band recorded the demo Escape the Fate EP. They signed in early 2006 with Epitaph Records after winning a radio contest judged by My Chemical Romance which launched their career .
In May 2006, recording for the EP There's No Sympathy for the Dead begun, as well as some songs from the debut album, Dying Is Your Latest Fashion. Both were produced by Radke's friend Michael "Elvis" Baskette.</p>

<a id="legal-issues" class="anchor" href="#legal-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LEGAL ISSUES</h3>

<p>Radke has been arrested on multiple occasions and faced controversy on other occasions, often for incidents involving violence.</p>

<p>In May 2006, Radke was involved in an altercation in Las Vegas that resulted in the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Cook. While Radke did not shoot Cook, he was indicted on battery charges, while the man who shot Cook claimed self-defense. These charges against Radke, combined with his past offenses of drug possession, led to a sentence of five years' probation.</p>

<p>Radke failed to report to his probation officer and was arrested in June 2008, where he was sentenced to four years in prison. However, he only served two and a half years of his sentence before being released. Radke was officially kicked out of Escape the Fate in mid-2008, and replaced by former Blessthefall vocalist Craig Mabbit.The single "Webs We Weave", which was meant to be released in 2008, would have been the third single from the debut album by Escape the Fate, but after the depart. Max Green, bassist of Escape the Fate, stated about Ronnie's law problems that, "First we couldn't tour out of the country, then out of the state." In an interview in prison, Radke said that the real culprits would be Chase Rader and Max Green, the first to be armed at the time of the fight, and the second was caused by the fight, but the two were acquitted claiming self-defense. Radke was released from prison on December 12, 2010.Since being released from prison in 2010, Radke has been arrested twice, the first being an August 6, 2012 arrest for alleged domestic violence against his girlfriend. Three hearings were scheduled, none of which Ronnie attended. According to Sergeant Tom Lorenz, the prosecutor of the County of Los Angeles issued the arrest warrant after Radke's girlfriend told police that he had hit her on May 1. Radke's arrest occurred without incident and he was released after paying $30,000 bail.</p>

<p>After the publication of his arrest, Ronnie published through his profile on Microblog that not everything can be considered truthful and asked for his fans to "not believe everything that appears online". Later, on September 29, 2012, during a concert with Falling in Reverse, Radke was arrested and charged with simple and aggravated assault following a show at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson Township, NJ. Towards the end of the band's performance, Radke threw three microphone stands into the crowd; two fans were hit and sustained head injuries. One victim was a 16-year-old girl who was taken to the hospital for treatment of a cut she received to the head, while the other was a 24-year-old man who was treated on the scene. Radke posted bail and was released.In the aftermath of the incident, Six Flags Great Adventure banned any future hard rock or heavy metal bands from performing in their theme park.</p>
